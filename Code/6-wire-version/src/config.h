 * WiFi Configuration Manager

 * Persistent data means, the data the ESP writes to it's internal memory,
 *  when a connection was established successfully.
 * Means not the data we write with the "WiFi Access Point" configuration below.
 *  (wifi.json on flash memory)
 *
 * NOTICE: If you want your ESP running continuously without creating an access point
 *  when having WiFi issues, set 'enableWmApFallback=false', otherwise we could fallback
 *  to this 'AP mode' on the upstart setup() job. This setting can be changed from web ui.
 *
 * WARNING: For the case you set 'enableWmApFallback=false' you could lock out
 *  yourself when loosing your home network. You would have to "Reset WiFi" but
 *  you are not able to connect to the Web GUI without a connection.
